Changes to defaults, most recent first:

- After v3.0.717, the user must specify a --chroot dir for chroot() to happen.
  We don't set a default in the configure script anymore.

- After v3.0.708, --debug was split into --verbose and --no-daemon.

- Since v3.0.694, darkstat is able to save its internal database into a file and
  reload it on startup.  The file format is, by design, incompatible with the
  format from darkstat v2.

- After v3.0.626, daemonizing can be suppressed with the "--debug" commandline
  argument, to force darkstat to stay in the foreground for debugging purposes.

  The "-d" argument is no longer recognized, and will prevent darkstat
  from starting, so make sure you adjust any startup scripts you may have.

- v3.0.540 and earlier defaulted to running in the foreground and had a "-d"
  commandline argument to get darkstat to daemonize, detach from the controlling
  terminal, and run in the background.

  After 540, the default has been inverted.  darkstat will daemonize by default.
