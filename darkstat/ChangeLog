v3.0.719 (24 May 2015)
	- Implement tracking of remote ports: shows which ports the host
	  is making outgoing connections to. Long time feature request.
	- Bugfix: when the capture interface goes down, exit instead of
	  busy-looping forever.
	- Fix "clock error" due to machine reboot.
	- SIGUSR1 now resets the time and bytes reported on the graphs
	  page.
	- Account for all IP protocols.
	- Change the default ports_max to only twice the default
	  ports_keep.

v3.0.718 (25 January 2014)
	- (SECURITY!) Don't chroot() by default.  The user must specify
	  a --chroot dir for this to happen now.
	- Bring back the "--base /path" functionality.
	- Add explicit warning about graphs being blank if we can't get
	  local IPs on an interface.
	- Don't crash in timer_stop() if monotonic time stops or goes
	  backwards.
	- Lots of internal cleanups.
	- Use time_t instead of "long" for time.  This is more correct
	  and should fix darkstat on OpenBSD 5.5 on 32-bit systems.

v3.0.717 (14 August 2013)
	- (OS X only) Work around lack of clock_gettime().
	- Fix crash due to str_appendf() not understanding %ld.

v3.0.716 (8 August 2013)
	- Implement support for multiple capture interfaces.
	- Support multiple local IPs on an interface.
	- Only error out if we fail to create all HTTP sockets.
	  In particular, this helps on IPv6-incapable platforms.
	- Use monotonic time over wall time where appropriate.
	- Portability fixes for NetBSD and OpenBSD.

v3.0.715 (January 2012)
	- Compatibility fixes for Hurd and Solaris.
	- Use link-time optimization and automake-like silent rules.
	- Support systems without ifaddrs.h again.
	- Continuing fixes for IPv6 support.
	- Only update lastseen time for sender, not recipient.
	- Implement --local-only: accounting for hosts on the local net.
	- Make failure to bind() a socket non-fatal.
	- Make failure to get local IP non-fatal.
	- Fall back to gethostbyaddr() if getnameinfo() fails.
	- Fix detection of IPv4 multicast addresses.
	- Fix decoding on OpenBSD DLT_NULL interfaces (e.g. gif(4))

v3.0.714 (June 2011)
	- IPv6 support!  Big ups to Mats Erik Andersson who did most
	  of this work!
	- Allow sort on last-seen, thanks to Dirk Koopman.
	- Support multiple bind addresses.
	- Add --disable-debug configure flag, thanks to Malte S. Stretz.
	- Make it possible to export the database without resetting it:
	  by sending SIGUSR2.
	- Web: Use relative URLs, so darkstat works properly
	  behind mod_proxy, thanks to Malte S. Stretz.

v3.0.713 (March 2010)
	- Don't require --verbose for pcap_stats.
	- Survive interface going down on Linux.
	- Support DLT_RAW, implemented by Anton S. Ustyuzhanin.
	- Skip accounting for hosts or ports if their max
	  is set to zero.
	- Implement --hexdump for troubleshooting.
	- Web: Implement --no-lastseen
	- Implement --snaplen manual override.
	- Fix snaplen problem on recent (1-2 years?) Linux kernels.
	- Implement --syslog
	- Implement --wait as a NetworkManager workaround.

(there were no releases made in 2009)

v3.0.712 (November 2008)
	- Web: Add --no-macs option to hide mac addresses.
	  Thanks Dennis!
	- Web: Make tables prettier.
	- Host detail view now triggers a DNS lookup.
	- Manpage tweaks, also move from section 1 to section 8.
	- Track and show how long ago a host was last seen.
	  Suggested by: Prof A Olowofoyeku (The African Chief)
	- Show pcap_stats (like number of packets dropped) in the web
	  interface and also upon exit.

v3.0.711 (August 2008)
	- Split --debug into --verbose and --no-daemon
	- Include launchd config and instructions for running darkstat
	  on Mac OS X.  Contributed by Damien Clauzel.
	- Implement PPPoE decoding on ethernet iface. (--pppoe)
	- Web: Add automatic reload button.  Thanks Dennis!
	- Web: Add a graph legend with min/avg/max.
	- Web: Remove hashtable stats pages.

v3.0.708 (May 2008)

	- Implement limiting of number of ports tracked per host,
	  configurable on the commandline (--ports-max)
	- Optionally don't track high ports (--highest-port)
	  Thanks Dennis!
	- Fix rare use-after-free resulting from hosts table reduction.
	- Make hosts limit configurable (--hosts-max)
	- Option to read from capfile as alternative to live capture
	  (really only useful for development, benchmarking)
	- Add the sniffed interface name to HTML reports.
	  Thanks Chris!

v3.0.707 (Sep 2007)

	- Fix silly bug in formatting hex.
	- Check for pcap.h in include/pcap/ for old RedHat-a-likes.
	- New commandline parser.
	- To stay in foreground, pass --debug instead of -d.
	- We can now reset all statistics at runtime (send SIGUSR1)
	- Make chroot dir configurable on cmdline (--chroot)
	- Make privdrop user configurable on cmdline (--user)
	- Implement daylog (brings back a v2 feature)
	- Import and export hosts and graphs, this brings back a fairly
	  major v2 feature.  Big ups to Ben for doing a lot of the
	  design and implementation of this feature!
	  Note that the v3 database format is, by design, incompatible
	  with the v2 format.
	- Report average KB/s in and out on graphs.
	  Thanks to Damian Lozinski for suggestion and first cut at the
	  implementation.
	- Fix graph rotation when the delay between rotations is big
	  enough to clear an entire graph.
	- Make ip_proto 8 bits wide, to match the IP header.
	- Implement pidfile functionality for people who prefer to
	  handle daemons in this manner.

v3.0.619 (Apr 2007)

	- Make daemonize (previously -d) the default, and make -D the
	  argument to suppress it.
	- Commandline arg (-l) to graph traffic entering/leaving the
	  local network as opposed to just the local IP.  v2 had this.
	- Allow configure-time override of CHROOT_DIR and PRIVDROP_USER.
	- Web: new color scheme.

v3.0.540 (Aug 2006)

	- Fix build against old libpcap (thanks Claudio)
	- Fix build on AIX (thanks Andreas)
	- Fix build warnings on NetBSD (thanks Bartosz)
	- Deny writes to BPF socket (thanks Can)

	  patch courtesy of Ingo Bressler

v3.0.524 (Jul 2006)

	- Fix build on NetBSD.
	- Fix shutdown on Linux.
	- Performance improvements.
	- Free the mallocs.
	- Work around BPF being immediate on Linux.
	  This improves performance.
	- Drop privileges when we don't need them.  Chroot.  Generally
	  be more paranoid.  Thanks to Chris Kuethe for patches and
	  inspiration.
	- Daemonize.  (run in the background)
	- Graphs: Make the entire bar have the same label (instead of
	  different labels for in/out), add thousands separators for
	  legibility, include the position/index (i.e. day 22)
	- Instead of reducing the hosts_db based on time, do it based on
	  its size.
	- Implement somewhat better handling of time moving backwards -
	  we assume that real time is monotonic and just renumber the
	  graph bars.  (time is hard)
	- Greatly improve IPC with the DNS child, make it more efficient
	  and much more robust.
	- Decode DLT_PPP_ETHER (pppoe0 on OpenBSD), patch courtesy of
	  Claudio Leite.

	stability.  Approximate feature parity with v2, missing
	loading/saving DB.

v2.6 (Nov 2003)

	End of the line for darkstat 2.
